# 🩺 PneumoDetect: Deep Learning for Pneumonia Detection & Clinician Triage Dashboard

---

**Duration:** 4 Weeks (20 Lab Days, Mon–Fri)
**Format:** Hands-on postgraduate programming lab
**Focus:** Deep Learning • Explainability • Flask Apps • MLOps • Ethics in AI

---

## Course Overview

Radiology teams face overwhelming imaging workloads. This lab guides you through building **PneumoDetect** — a deep-learning model that detects pneumonia from chest X-rays and surfaces explainable Grad-CAM overlays inside a clinician-style triage dashboard.

You’ll move from raw NIH/RSNA image data to a deployed Flask app in four structured sprints, gaining practical skills in data handling, transfer learning, explainability, deployment, and bias evaluation.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing PneumoDetect, you will be able to:

1. **Engineer medical imaging pipelines** for deep learning using PyTorch.
2. **Train and evaluate** transfer-learning CNNs with balanced sampling.
3. **Implement explainability methods** (Grad-CAM) for clinician insight.
4. **Develop and deploy** Flask web apps with CI/CD and Docker.
5. **Assess model bias** and communicate ethical limitations clearly.

## Reflective Practice

Each Friday concludes with a short reflection blog:

* *Week 1 – “Cleaning the Chaos: Making X-rays Trainable”*
* *Week 2 – “Teaching the Model to Explain Itself”*
* *Week 3 – “Where AI Meets the Clinician’s Screen”*
* *Week 4 – “Deployment, Bias, and the Human Context”*

These reflections document your growth and reinforce professional communication skills valued in industry and research.
